Metriq is a free and open source platform that helps researchers and developers benchmark quantum computers. It provides a collaborative environment where users can share their benchmarking results, compare different quantum devices, discuss methodologies, and contribute to the development of new benchmarks.

It consists of three main components, including 
- metriq-gym: a Python toolkit for running benchmarks and submitting results to the platform,
- metriq-data: a dataset of benchmarking results from various quantum devices, and
- metriq-web: a website for sharing, visualizing, and discussing the dataset.
