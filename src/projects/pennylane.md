_Create meaningful quantum algorithms, from inspiration to implementation._

[PennyLane](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane) is an open-source quantum software platform for designing, compiling, and realizing meaningful quantum algorithms. Backed by the most extensive library of research demos, it provides high-performance simulators, access to quantum hardware, compilation at scale, and industrial resource estimation—allowing you to implement algorithms alongside the realities of quantum hardware.

**Inspiration to implementation, quickly.**
Quantum computing can be complex — PennyLane makes it natural. Leverage the world’s largest library of research demos and state-of-the-art components to build algorithms in quantum chemistry, quantum information, optimization, and quantum machine learning.

**Fast where it matters. Scalable where it counts.**
Whether executing, compiling, or analyzing, PennyLane is fast. Unlock production-grade performance with industrial resource estimation and the Catalyst compiler. Scale up your workflows with the high-performance Lightning simulators on GPUs, supercomputers, and the cloud.

**Hardware agnostic, hardware ready.**
PennyLane integrates with a wide range of quantum hardware devices. Whether superconducting qubits, trapped ion systems, neutral atoms, or photonics, PennyLane provides the tools to estimate resources and compile circuits specifically for the hardware devices of today—and tomorrow!

**Participate, collaborate, innovate.**
PennyLane is the world’s most active quantum community. You’re part of a global network of researchers, developers, and educators actively defining the frontier of quantum computing. Whether quantum is your day job or you’re getting your first taste at a hackathon, you’re backed by the most responsive community in the field.
